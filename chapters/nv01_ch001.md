### Chapter 1

Excuse me if this sounds stupid: but I've always found that places have a feeling. Sure, it's occurred to me that's not a particularly insightful notion. The academy classrooms were all too often dreary; there's a certain calmness about the forest that surrounds my family's country estate; the Eastern battlefronts were a strange dichotomy of spontaneous courage and piss-yourself-terror. And I've been told that home was supposed to feel... homey.

But places have more than just their atmosphere. They have their people. They have their memories.

Strange emotions flooded in as I watched some of those memories flicker past through the polished windows of the train car. Even the distinct rumbling of the inbound train was nostalgic as we rumbled towards the Central Railway Station. It was particularly loud as it echoed through the luxurious cabin, empty, save for a lone passenger.

On the left lay the Sandwarren Market where my childhood self had given my caretakers a heart attack by scaling the enormous arch in the market's heart. Adjacent was the grand Stauffer Planetarium where my mother had taken us children on every possible occasion.

However, besides the Market towered the Imperial Military Academy. Likewise, Stauffer deferred itself to the nearby Imperial Palace, whose spires dwarfed its observatory and whose sponsorship buttressed its walls. That wasn't to say that the combination made the imperial capital of Entuica ugly; rather the architecture melded together to make the most beautiful city on the continent.

Entuica was home. It just didn't quite have that feeling. And I was never one for aesthetics.

My thoughts were interrupted by a knocking at the cabin's door. "Sir, we are on the final approach."

I made to leave and gave a final glance outside the tinted glass windows. What I saw caused me to double-take: a mushroom of black smoke was blooming in the district past the market. I froze for a moment, confused. The shockwave hit me then, shattering the train car's windows and thumping into my eardrums.

Was it just an accident? Something of that scale?

I burst into the hallway where other first-class passengers began swarming the panicked attendant who reassured them the explosion was surely just an accident. I stood there processing the sight for a moment when the train screeched to a halt. With the station in sight, the train hadn't been moving too fast, but the sudden deceleration flung several of the passengers off their feet, one which caught their balance against my jacket.

"Tha-" the lady started, only to cut herself off and jump back. She had seen my family crest.

So much for the uneventful return that my father had been hoping for, not that there was much hope of that anymore. "Keep it quiet," I whispered.

"O-of course, Lord Rigel."

"And tell the attendant to send my belongings to the Rigel Mansion."

She seemed confused about the command but I paid that little mind. More pressing concerns were entering my mind.

I swung back through into my cabin and vaulted out the broken window. I alighted into the middle of a set of four elevated railways below which ran a busy commercial thoroughfare. The station was not three hundred meters to my right, and while I could make the short run and find a way off the rails, that would take precious time.

Instead, I produced a fingernail-sized vis crystal from my pocket, and I ran, leaping the small gaps between the rails. As the last of the stone bridges fell out behind me, I flung myself into the open air and the gasps of bystanders below. Instead of cratering into the crowd, I fised the vis crystal between my fingers. The vis coursed through my veins, erupting into twin jets of flames at my palms atop which I balanced and landed.

There was no time to reassure the policemen who had taken out their vis crystals in anticipated defence. There was no time to even catch my breath. All I could do was flash the Crest of House Rigel to placate their pursuit, before double-timing it towards the rising plume of smoke.

My senses must have dulled over the past year of sleepy postings. I should have recognized the explosion immediately. It wasn't a failed industrial process, nor some accident. I had seen thousands of those detonations before, but I'd never thought I'd see one over Entuica's skyline.

My lungs groaned from a year of underuse, but I pressed on. While I couldn't revert the damage, I would sure as hell prevent a follow-up.

That sentiment was shared by the policemen I found at the attack's epicentre. There must have been two hundred of them, locking down the district. And for each policeman, they were half a dozen other responders: paramedics, firemen, and a mass of good samaritans. The last of these were chased away as a battalion from the city garrison rolled down Fourth Boulevard.

The response was well warranted for the aftermath was far greater than I'd anticipated. The Gerris Lane Registry was one of the older Ministry buildings, situated near the Historic Town Centre, and crafted of marble in the old Imperial style. Although beautiful up, I never had reason to visit, although the common folk often did, a fact that made the currently smouldering rumble all the more grisly.

Such utter devastation was common for a visic bombardment although this level of damage was typically restricted to airship-mounted munitions. No... I couldn't believe that the enemy bombers capable of the feat could penetrate so far into the imperial heartlands.

A firm hand grasped my shoulder before I could investigate further. I must have seemed somewhat important since the young soldier who'd restrained me bore the Insignia of a Garrison Lieutenant. "Sir, I'll have to ask that you vacate the premises."

I noted the officer's sharp eyes and spotless uniform. Coughing a bit, I reluctantly displayed my family crest. "Humor me a little, lieutenant. I'd like to examine the attack."

A brief frown flashed across his face, although he didn't contradict my presumption. The frown was promptly replaced by a professional smile. "Of course, Lord Rigel."

"Drop the honorifics, I'll need to keep things quiet."

"Of course, sir."

"Your name then, lieutenant? "

"Meurs, Second Liutentant Meurs of the Garisson of Entuica."

I nodded. "Alright, Meurs. You know anything of these attacks?"

His lips thinned. "It's not the first one, sir."

I raised my eyebrows. "Not the first?"

"The third this month, sir. They've hit one of the intracity-rail stations and one of the outer markets. Granted, this last one has been the largest. The last two have been more discrete."

That made quite a bit of sense given the scale and promptness of the relief effort. The city garrison must have made the two-mile march from the riverside barracks in the time I'd take to run over. Moreover, private forces from the nearby noble estate were now pouring into the site.

"The cause has been suppressed from the public: something of an open secret, but I'd assume that with your channels..." Meurs continued.

"I've been out of the city."

"Understood, sir."

I turned my attention back towards the remains of the Registry. "I don't suppose you haven't found anything of these... terrorists?"

"No, sir. The brass has us all pulling double duty. We're looking, but there have been no leads at all."

It would have to be quite a small team to avoid the entirety of the city authorities, especially given the lack of local support and logistics. How would they have even smuggled in the visic explosives?

I scratch my chin. I knew it probably wasn't worth the trouble to look further. I was due to leave Entucia within a few days, and I doubted my experience would add much. The Garrison had its own experts and the cooperation of the nobility.

I turned back to the fresh-faced lieutenant.

"Sir?"

"Walk with me, Meurs. Let's take a closer look."

He blinked. "I haven't the specialization. Shall I call forensiâ€”"

"It's fine," I said. "Just keep up."

"Y-yes, sir."

It must have been a strange sight
