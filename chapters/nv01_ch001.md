### Chapter 1

I've always found that places have a feeling. Sure, it's occurred to me that's not a particularly insightful notion. The academy classrooms were all too often dreary; there's a certain calmness about the forest that surrounds my's estate; the Eastern battle fronts were a strange dichotomy of spontaneous courage and piss-yourself-terror. And I've been told that home was supposed to feel... homey.

But places have more than just thier atomsphere. They have thier people. They have their memories.

I watched some of those memories flicker past as the train screeched towards Central Railway Station. On the left lay the Sandwarren Market where my childhood self had given my caretakers a heart attack by scaling the enormous arch in the market's heart. Beside it was the grand Stauffer Planetarium where my mother had taken us children on every possible occasion.

However, besides the Market towered the Imperial Military Academy. Likewise, Stauffer deferred itself to the adjacent Imperial Palace, whose spires dwarfed its observatory and whose sponsorship buttressed its walls. Thus was the imperial capital of Entuica. And it was home, but it didn't quite have the feeling.

My fleeting thoughts were interrupted by a knocking at the cabin's door. "Sir, we are on the final approach," a cabin attendant called as the sound of footsteps indicated his retreat.

I gave a final glance outside the tinted glass windows and made to leave. What I saw caused me to double-take: a mushroom of black smoke was visible in the district past the market. The sound hit me then, shattering the train car's windows and thumping into my eardrums.

I burst into the hallway where other first-class passengers began swarming the panicked attendant who reassured them the explosion must have just been and accident. I stood there processing the sight for a moment when the train screeched to a halt. With the station in sight, the train hadn't been moving too fast, but the sudden deceleration flung several of the passengers off their feet, one which caught their balance against my jacket.

"Tha-" the lady started, only to cut herself off and jump back. She had seen my family crest.

So much for the uneventful return that my father had been hoping for, not that there was much hope of that anymore. "Keep it quiet," I whispered.

"O-of course, Lord Rigel."

"And tell the attendant to send my belongings to the Rigel Mansion."

She seemed confused about the command but I paid that little mind. More pressing concerns were entering my mind.

I swung back through into my cabin and vaulted out the broken window. I alighted into the middle of a set of four elevated railways below which ran a busy commercial thoroughfare. The station was not three hundred meters to my right, and while I could make the short run and find a way off the rails, that would take precious time.

Instead, I produced a fingernail-sized vis crystal from my pocket, and I ran, leaping the small gaps between the rails. As the last of the stone bridges fell out behind me, I flung myself into the open air and the gasps of bystanders below. Instead of cratering into the crowd, I fised the vis crystal between my fingers. The vis coursed through my veins, erupting into twin jets of flames at my palms atop which I balanced and landed.

There was no time to reassure the policemen who had taken out their vis crystals in the anticipated assault. There was no time to even catch my breath. All I could do was flash the Crest of House Rigel to placate their pursuit, before double-timing it towards the rising plume of smoke.

My senses must have dulled over the past year of sleepy postings. I should have recognized the explosion immediately. It wasn't a failed industrial process, nor some accident. I had seen thousands of those detonations before, but I'd never thought I'd see one over Entuica's skyline.

And while I couldn't revert the damage, I could sure as hell prevent a follow-up

That sentiment was shared by the countless policemen I found in the
