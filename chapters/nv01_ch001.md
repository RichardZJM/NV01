### Chapter 1

I've always found that places have a feeling. Sure, it's occurred to me that's not a particularly insightful notion. The academy classrooms were all too often dreary; there's a certain calmness about the forest that surrounds my family's country estate; the Eastern battlefronts were a strange dichotomy of spontaneous courage and piss-yourself-terror. And I've been told that home was supposed to feel... homey.

But places have more than just their atmosphere. They have their people. They have their memories.

Strange emotions flooded in as I watched some of those memories flicker past through the polished windows of the train car. Even the distinct rumbling of the inbound train was nostalgic as we rumbled towards the Central Railway Station. It was particularly loud as it echoed through the luxurious cabin, empty, save for a lone passenger.

On the left lay the Sandwarren Market where my childhood self had given my caretakers a heart attack by scaling the enormous arch in the market's heart. Adjacent was the grand Stauffer Planetarium where my mother had taken us children on every possible occasion.

However, besides the Market towered the Imperial Military Academy. Likewise, Stauffer deferred itself to the nearby Lans Imperial Palace, whose spires dwarfed its observatory and whose sponsorship buttressed its walls. That wasn't to say that the combination made the imperial capital of Entuica ugly; rather the architecture melded together to make the most beautiful city on the continent.

Entuica was home. It just didn't quite have that feeling, and I was never one for aesthetics.

My thoughts were interrupted by a knocking at the cabin's door. "Sir, we are on the final approach."

I made to leave and gave a final glance outside the tinted glass windows. What I saw caused me to double-take: a mushroom of black smoke was blooming in the district past the market. I froze for a moment, confused. The shockwave hit me then, shattering the train car's windows and urging me into motion.

Was it just an accident? Something of that scale?

I burst into the hallway where other first-class passengers began swarming the panicked attendant who reassured them the explosion was surely just an accident. I stood there processing the sight for a moment when the train screeched to a halt. With the station in sight, the train hadn't been moving too fast, but the sudden deceleration flung several of the passengers off their feet, one which caught their balance against my jacket.

"Tha-" the lady started, only to cut herself off and jump back. She had seen my family crest.

So much for the uneventful return that my father had been hoping for. "Keep it quiet," I whispered.

"O-of course, Lord Rigel."

"And tell the attendant to send my belongings to the Rigel Mansion."

She seemed confused about the command but I paid that little mind.

I swung back through into my cabin and vaulted out the broken window. I had alighted into the middle of a set of four elevated railways below which ran a busy commercial thoroughfare. The station was not three hundred meters to my right, and while I could make the short run and find a way off the rails, that would take precious time.

Instead, I produced a fingernail-sized vis crystal from my pocket, and I ran, leaping the small gaps between the rails. As the last of the stone bridges fell out behind me, I flung myself into the open air and the gasps of bystanders below. Instead of cratering into the crowd, I fised the vis crystal between my fingers. The vis coursed through my veins, erupting into twin jets of flames at my palms atop which I balanced and landed.

There was no time to reassure the policemen who had taken out their vis crystals in anticipated defence. There was no time to even catch my breath. All I could do was flash the Crest of House Rigel to placate their pursuit, before double-timing it towards the rising plume of smoke.

My senses must have dulled over the past year of sleepy postings. I should have recognized the explosion immediately. It wasn't a failed industrial process, nor some accident. I had seen thousands of those detonations before, but I'd never thought I'd see one over Entuica's skyline.

My lungs groaned from a year of underuse, but I pressed on. While I couldn't revert the damage, I would sure as hell prevent a follow-up.

That sentiment was shared by the policemen I found at the attack's epicentre. There must have been two hundred of them, locking down the district. And for each policeman, they were half a dozen other responders: paramedics, firemen, and a mass of good samaritans. The last of these were chased away as a battalion from the city garrison rolled down Fourth Boulevard.

The response was well warranted for the aftermath was far greater than I'd anticipated. The Gerris Lane Registry was one of the older Ministry buildings, situated near the Historic Town Centre, and crafted of marble in the old Imperial style. Although beautiful up, I never had reason to visit, although the common folk often did, a fact that made the currently smouldering rumble all the more grisly.

Such utter devastation was common for a visic bombardment although this level of damage was typically restricted to airship-mounted munitions. No... I couldn't believe that the enemy bombers capable of the feat could penetrate so far into the imperial heartlands.

A firm hand grasped my shoulder before I could investigate further. I must have seemed somewhat important since the young soldier who'd restrained me bore the Insignia of a Garrison Lieutenant. "Sir, I'll have to ask that you vacate the premises."

I noted the officer's sharp eyes and spotless uniform. Coughing a bit, I reluctantly displayed my family crest. "Humor me a little, lieutenant. I'd like to examine the attack."

A brief frown flashed across his face, although he didn't contradict my presumption. The frown was promptly replaced by a professional smile. "Of course, Lord Rigel."

"Drop the honorifics, I'll need to keep things quiet."

"Of course, sir."

"Your name then, lieutenant? "

"Meurs, Second Liutentant Meurs of the Garisson of Entuica."

I nodded. "Alright, Meurs. You know anything of these attacks?"

His lips thinned. "It's not the first one, sir."

I raised my eyebrows. "Not the first?"

"The third in two months, sir. They've hit one of the intracity-rail stations and one of the outer markets. Granted, this last one has been the largest. The last two have been more discrete."

That made quite a bit of sense given the scale and promptness of the relief effort. The city garrison must have made the two-mile march from the riverside barracks in the time I'd take to run over. Moreover, private forces from the nearby noble estate were now pouring into the site.

"The cause has been suppressed from the public: something of an open secret, but I'd assume that with your channels..." Meurs continued.

"I've been out of the city."

"Understood, sir."

I turned my attention back towards the remains of the Registry. "I don't suppose you haven't found anything of these... terrorists?"

"No, sir. The brass has us all pulling double duty. We're looking, but there have been no leads at all."

It would have to be quite a small team to avoid the entirety of the city authorities, especially given the lack of local support and logistics. How would they have even smuggled in the visic explosives?

I scratch my chin. I knew it probably wasn't worth the trouble to look further. I was due to leave Entucia within a few days, and I doubted my experience would add much. The Garrison had its own experts and the cooperation of the nobility.

I turned back to the fresh-faced lieutenant.

"Sir?"

"Walk with me, Meurs. Let's take a closer look."

He blinked. "I don't the specialization. Shall I call forensiâ€”"

"It's fine. Just keep up."

"Y-yes, sir."

It might have been a strange sight to the see a stranger in civilian garb climbing through the rubble but no one stopped. The sight of the lieutenant scrambling behind me must have reassured the troops since no one stopped us. We made quick work of the terrain, only impeded by the dust and a small wall of cobbles.

Soon, we arrived at the atrium, at least what remained of it. There had been a skylight in the center, and the collapse of the ceilings had left a ring of relatively intact if blackened, flooring.

The subterranean levels had mostly collapsed, and workers were frantically casting visic spells to search for the entombed. I had half a mind to help although my visic skillset was ill-suited for the task and the severity of the blast would leave few survivors if any. Meurs, however, seemed itching to act.

"Just a moment. Before you help them." I requested.

"Of course, sir."

"I grew up in this city, but I rarely visited the registries. Would you be familiar with this building? When it was intact, I mean."

"Somewhat. My father was a leatherworker for one of the nearby shoemakers."
"I remember there was a staircase, probably now that pile of stone just scaled. The registry had an archway, leading to the atrium. You could see into the building when the doors were open in the summertime. There were a series of pillars that held up the central arch."

Meurs nodded slowly. "That's accurate."

I sniffed and observed the stumps that were once pillars. Typical of the Asecint Era's architecture, they were wholly overbuilt, more than two meters in width and visically carved out of solid marble. Despite that, half their number were severed at the base, and the others had toppled. I suspected that the damage continued into the basements which were likely hardened against attack.

Meurs was shuffling behind me, and I could see the gears turning in his head. So, I gave him a wave. "Thank you, Lieutenant. I'll be fine on my own."

He seemed to want to add something but gave a snappy Lans salute and rushed off.

The salute told me he'd realized some of my background, not surprising given the tendency of noble descendants to serve with the Imperial Army, and that was discounting the martial heritage of my house.

House Rigel had a proud history of front-line leadership across the Harion continent. Even though the Eastern Front had ground into a stalemate for four years now, I had seen my share of combat. No, I'd never had to take direct action, but the daily exchanges of visic artillery and aerial bombardments were all too familiar.

That's why the terrorist attack was screaming at my instincts.

The damage was too much for a simple demonstration. This was the kind of thing that took a pair of Rizetian heavy bombers to pull off, and those flying behemoths dropped visic explosives by the half-ton. The terrorists would have had to smuggle all of that in and plant without discovery.

How would they have gotten so much explosive into the city? What was the affiliation? Probably one of the three states against whom the empire currently warred. In that case, how did they get the support for their operations, so deep into the empire?

I gave these questions a few minutes' thought and turned away from the wreckage. There was little left for me to do, and the first of the survivors were emerging from beneath the rumble. Other noble factions were already swarming around, and overstaying would draw unnecessary attention. I called over one of the city garrison personnel, requesting a possible meeting with Meurs the next day. Perhaps the authorities would find more than I would.

Then, I simply left.

My family had originally arranged to pick me up a the station although there was little chance of that happening. A lockdown had been imposed following the attack, and the intracity monorail was out of commission. Maybe I could have gotten the garrison to lend me a ride, but I was content to walk.

The thoughts I'd been suppressing bubbled up again. What did my father want this time? He hadn't even called me back to the capital when I'd sent him that letter two years ago. After that, he'd thought of me as his greatest disappointment, but he was the kind of man to sweep such failures under the rug. What had changed so suddenly?

The Rigel Manor lined the Ent River waterfront, a stone's throw from the political heart of the empire and across from eyot that held so many of the city's famous restaurants and shops. I followed Fifth Avenue, one of the quieter main roads which housed a disproportionate amount of schools and aspiring scholars. I might have been too distracted or else, the road was shorter than my memories, because I quickly arrived.

The manor wasn't much different from what I'd remember although, admittedly, a couple of years wouldn't amount to much. The late afternoon shone over the same black-iron fence which shone over the same six acres of the same polished lawns and exotic flora. The manor itself was more modern than the surroundings, but supposed in style with an obsession for larger-than-needed features and minimalism. My father's wife never shut up about the praises the Foreign Minister had supposedly given when he'd visited a decade prior.

Thankfully, the guards were much the same too. Otherwise, my soot-covered jacket and torn trousers might have gotten me chased away as a vagabond. Instead, they called up the first familiar face I'd seen since my return.

"Arran!" called the mustachioed captain who enveloped me in a great bear hug.

"It's good to see you too, Captain Krag, " I chuckled as I echoed the gesture.

We broke apart and, Wallace Krag, Captian of the Rigel Manor Guards, looked me up and down. "You've finally put some meat on those bones!"

"I've been off of the frontlines for some time. All I can say is that the supply troops eat good."

Krag bellowed in laughter.""
